# 20-Questions
Repository for IGME201 Homework assignment "20 Questions".

## Description:
Inspired by 20 Questions, this geographical guessing game might just teach you a thing or two about the many countries of this world.

**How to play:**

The player picks a country, the program tries to guess the country by asking a series of yes-no questions about it. If the program guesses the right country, the player loses. If the program guesses the wrong country, the player wins.
When the program loses, it learns by asking the player about their country. You can't win the same way twice, so think carefully!
