# 20-Questions
Inspired by 20 Questions, this geographical guessing game may just teach you a thing or two about the many countries of the world.
## Description:
**Tech used:** C#, Visual Studio, Google Workspace (Docs/Sheets)

*You* (the player) will choose a country. *The Guesser* (the program) tries to guess your country by asking a series of yes-no questions.
  - If the program guesses the right country, the player loses. 
  - If the program guesses the wrong country, the player wins.

When the program loses, it learns by asking the player about their country. You can't win the same way twice, so *think carefully*!
