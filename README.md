# 20-Questions

## Description:

Inspired by 20 Questions, this geographical guessing game might just teach you a thing or two about the many countries of this world.

**Tech used:** C#, Visual Studio, Google Workspace (Docs/Sheets)

**How to play:** 
**You** (*the player*) choose a country. **The Guesser** (*the program*) tries to guess your country by asking a series of yes-no questions.
  - If the program guesses the right country, the player loses. 
  - If the program guesses the wrong country, the player wins.

When the program loses, it learns by asking the player about their country. You can't win the same way twice, so *think carefully*!
